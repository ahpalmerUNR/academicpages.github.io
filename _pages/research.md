Intent Recognition in Socially Aware Navigation
------
My research into intent recognition for the purposes of socially aware navigation uses a combination of computer vision and laser data to evaluate the intent of people in a given environment. The goal is to combine the intent recognition with path planning to generate more socially appropriate navigation than traditional path planning.

Human Pose Detection for Computer Vision
------
Because of my focus on intent recognition for SAN, I have had to use a lot of software aimed at human pose detection. However, much of the systems suffer from slow compute times or scale varient issues. As a consequence of this, I have begun searching for better and faster ways of estimating human pose from images. 

Dynamic Action Spaces in Reinforcement Learning
------
Reinforcement learning is a powerful machine learning technique that allows the system to perform unsupervised learning. However, traditional RL suffers from large state-action spaces. This research focuses on reducing the complexity of RL state-action spaces by performing dynamic allocation of actions in a state space.
