Intent Recognition in Socially Aware Navigation
======
My research into intent recognition for the purposes of socially aware navigation uses a combination of computer vision and laser data to evaluate the intent of people in a given environment. The goal is to combine the intent recognition with path planning to generate more socially appropriate navigation than traditional path planning.

Adjustable Autonomy in Robotic Systems
======
This research is the basis of my master's thesis. It involves looking at how mmachine learning techniques can improve upon the transitions between levels of autonomy in an adjustable autonomy system. The system will examine user's patterns to anticipate appropriate autonomy levels.

Dynamic Action Spaces in Reinforcement Learning
======
Reinforcement learning is a powerful machine learning technique that allows the system to perform unsupervised learning. However, traditional RL suffers from large state-action spaces. This research focuses on reducing the complexity of RL state-action spaces by performing dynamic allocation of actions in a state space.
