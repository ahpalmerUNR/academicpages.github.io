Work experience
======
* Summer 2020: Participant Innovation Summit Series
  * Remote Participation at Army Research Laboratory/University of Nevada, Reno
  * Participated in weekly meetings to discuss potential research projects in human-robot teaming. Supported efforts by PIs in seeking grant funding by discussing prior research methodologies and systems. 
  * Required Skills: Knowledge of current HRI research, communication, team formation and emergent properties, and data analysis and filtering.
  * Supervisor: [Monica Nicolescu](https://www.cse.unr.edu/~monica/)
  
* Fall 2017 - Current: Graduate Research Assistant
  * SARG LAB at University of Nevada, Reno
  * Conducting research in intent recognition for social navigation. Wrote programs to calibrate sensors, detect and track people in 3D space from 2D sensors, and determine intent of people within view using Neural Networks trained on collected data. Replication of published methods in RL, GA's, ML, and CV also required while conducting research. General maintenance and care of the PR2 robot also included in assigned tasks.
  * Required Skills: C++, Python, ROS, OpenCV, Pytorch, Cuda, Gazebo, stochastic models, data analysis, filtering, and knowledge of current HRI research.
  * Supervisor: [Monica Nicolescu](https://www.cse.unr.edu/~monica/)
  
* Summer 2018, 2019: REU Mentor
  * SARG LAB at University of Nevada, Reno
  * Responsible for guiding 7 REU students, over both years, in independent research tasks. Tasks include providing critiques and information on good research techniques, helping students find relevant research papers, teaching undergraduates how to manage research and course work, and advised students on coding best practices on a weekly basis. Two of these students have had their work accepted at Humanoids and RO-MAN.
  * Skills: C++, Python, ROS, Git, data analysis, and knowledge of current HRI research.
  * Supervisors: [Monica Nicolescu](https://www.cse.unr.edu/~monica/) and [David Feil-Seifer](https://www.cse.unr.edu/~dave/)
  
* Fall 2015 - Spring 2016: Math Tutor
  * Math Center at University of Nevada, Reno
  * Tutoring undergraduate students in a wide range of math topics from remedial algebra to partial differential equations. Conducting group study sessions in preparation for midterms and finals across all levels of mathematics. Maintaining a constructive learning environment for large groups of students. Understanding student needs across a student body with varying abilities and skill sets.
  * Required Skills: Basic math to partial differential equations, tutoring, communication, problem solving, and speaking.
  * Supervisor: [Danelle Clarke](ddclarke@unr.edu)

Service and leadership
======
* Fall 2018 -- Oversaw 5 undergraduate students conducting research for my HRI Approach Behavior study. Trained students how to proctor participants as well as maneuver the robot into position and run experiment code for each trial.
* 2017-2018 -- Mentored 2 high school students in robotics several times a week. Managed weekly tasks and guided the student’s progress. Demonstrated principles of robotic design as well supervised the implementation of the student’s project.
* 2017-2018 -- Robotics lab tours and demonstrations to the public. Talked about the various research done in the UNR SARG lab as well as answered questions about the robots and the research.
* 2015-2016 -- Vice president of the UNR Math Club. Planned and managed public events for the advancement of interests in mathematics. Math club events ranged from movie nights to guest lectures. Took the club from an idea into a group of 30+ with growing membership.
